# 2026-02-25 — Coding Session (Telegram group: coding)

## GitHub App Setup
- Created GitHub App "Ada Bot" for teapotlabs org (App ID: 2937126, Installation ID: 112111851)
- Private key stored at `~/.config/github-app/ada-bot.pem`
- Config at `~/.config/github-app/config.json`
- Helper script `~/.local/bin/gh-app-token` mints short-lived tokens
- Repos accessible: joice, marketing-engine, analytics, openclaw, AIProxySwift
- Projects v2 GraphQL access still broken (known GitHub Apps limitation)
- ⚠️ Private key was shared in group chat — should be rotated

## Joice Repo — PRs Created
- **PR #48**: A/B Testing Framework (prompts, evaluate, dashboard, seed) — metric changed to human word count per call, switched AI to Claude Sonnet
- **PR #49**: Enhanced Mixpanel Analytics (comprehensive event tracking)
- **PR #50**: Streaks & Calendar Heat Map (Activity tab replacing Schedule)
- **PR #51**: Weekly Reflection Digest (AI-generated weekly summaries)
- **PR #52**: Share Themes as Branded Image Cards
- **PR #64**: Joice Remembers — cross-session context & memory
- **PR #65**: Smart Notifications — behavior-triggered & contextual
- **PR #68**: Website — landing page + privacy policy + terms of service

## Joice Repo — Issues Created
- **#53**: Migrate Realtime API from WebSocket to WebRTC
- **#54**: Milestone Celebrations
- **#55**: On This Day Lookbacks
- **#56**: Growth Visualization
- **#57**: Joice Remembers
- **#58**: Smart Notifications
- **#59**: Joice Wrapped (monthly shareable recaps — highest k-factor potential)
- **#60**: Referral Program
- **#61**: Journal Together (accountability pairs)
- **#62**: Guided Challenges
- **#63**: Session Starters
- **#66**: App Store Compliance Audit (resolved items 1-3, 5-6 on onboard_sprucing)
- **#67**: Remaining Pre-Launch Tasks (updated to use Adapty instead of raw StoreKit)

## Marketing-Engine Repo — Issues Created
- **#12**: End-to-End Social Media Content Pipeline (Nano Banana, Veo, Kling via FAL, native carousels, Buffer for posting)
- **#13**: Automated Meta Ads Generator & Testing Pipeline

## App Store Compliance — Resolved on onboard_sprucing branch
- Added Restore Purchases button with AppStore.sync()
- Full Apple-required subscription legal text
- Created PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy privacy manifest
- Softened health claims framing ("What would you like to work on?")
- Added mental health disclaimer + 988 crisis lifeline
- Voice → AI disclosure on privacy and mic permission pages
- AI-generated content labels on themes and journal titles

## Key Decisions
- Kavi changed plan from Superwall to **Adapty** for subscription management
- **Codex** for coding, **Opus** for planning/writing (model selection rule)
- All GitHub activity must include AI model attribution
- Native carousels for social media slideshows (not video stitching)
- Buffer API as middleware for social media posting (avoid TikTok/Meta API audits)

## Joice Codebase Notes
- iOS app: SwiftUI, Supabase backend, AIProxy for OpenAI relay
- Realtime voice via OpenAI Realtime API (WebSocket through AIProxySwift)
- DB tables: calls, transcript_messages (speaker: 'You'/'AI'), themes
- Design tokens in DesignTokens.swift (BrandColors.primary = #C17F59 terracotta)
- Existing features: voice journaling, transcripts, themes, scheduling, CallKit integration
- onboard_sprucing branch has reworked onboarding + hard paywall skeleton
